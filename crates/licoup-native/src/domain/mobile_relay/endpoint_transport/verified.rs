//! The verified-unit facts this boundary consumes.
//!
//! Verification belongs to the pinned SDK, which this domain reaches only
//! through `licoup_protocol_bindings`. This boundary verifies nothing and
//! decides no protocol outcome: it consumes one [`VerifiedUnit`] value that the
//! SDK boundary produced, and records what that value says. A value of
//! [`PeerMessage`](super::PeerMessage) therefore always names a unit some SDK
//! verification entry actually produced.
//!
//! # Producer
//!
//! The SDK boundary owns the producer. Its entries are
//! `licoup_protocol_bindings::EndpointConsumer::accept_handshake` (which yields
//! an `InboundSession`) and `InboundSession::receive_record` (which yields the
//! `TrustFacts` of one committed protected record). Nothing here re-implements,
//! previews, or second-guesses them: the trait below is only the shape this
//! domain reads, and the adapter below is this domain's one implementation of it
//! for the boundary's own fact value, so no second facts type has to be kept in
//! step.
//!
//! # Plug-in point
//!
//! [`VerifiedUnit`] is implemented for `licoup_protocol_bindings::TrustFacts`:
//!
//! * `verified_author` reads `TrustFacts::author().user_authority_state_digest`;
//! * `verified_device` reads `TrustFacts::device()`;
//! * `verified_record` reads `TrustFacts::replay_identity()` and chooses
//!   `RecordKey = licoup_protocol_bindings::ReplayIdentity`, answering `None`
//!   for the handshake variant so an accepted handshake can never be admitted
//!   as a message unit.
//!
//! That implementation is the only one: callers and fixtures consume it instead
//! of declaring their own copy of the boundary's facts.
//!
//! No other file in this domain changes when that adapter is added.
